NLP-Based Research Paper Recommendation System

📘 Overview

The NLP Research Paper Recommendation System is a hybrid AI-based application that helps researchers automatically find semantically similar academic papers based on the content of a given research PDF.  
It uses Natural Language Processing (NLP), Latent Semantic Analysis (LSA), and Sentence-BERT embeddings to provide context-aware and accurate recommendations.

This project was developed and tested on **Google Colab**, using the arXiv dataset from Cornell University (via KaggleHub).

🚀 Features

- 📂 PDF Upload Support – Automatically extracts text from research paper PDFs using PyMuPDF.  
- 🧮 Hybrid Recommendation Pipeline – Combines statistical (SVD) and deep learning (Sentence-BERT) methods.  
- ⚡ FAISS Similarity Search – Enables fast and efficient similarity computation for large datasets.  
- 🔍 Semantic Understanding – Goes beyond keyword matching to understand contextual meaning.  
- 🧠 Sentence-BERT Embeddings – Provides deep semantic representations for ranking related papers.  
- 📊 Scalable Design – Can handle tens of thousands of papers efficiently in Colab.
